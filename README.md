### Object Detection Project on Brain-Tumor-Prediction and deploying it using 'Flask'

This is an end to end project related to 'Object Detection' in which I have used 'Brain Tumor Detection' dataset from RoboFlow Universe

Link to Dataset -: [https://universe.roboflow.com/kolli-neelima/brain-tumor-swsor](url)  

**Dataset Description**
There are 4 classes in this dataset -: glioma , meningioma , pitutary aand no tumor 

**Project Structure**-:
1.README.md -: Contains a brief description about the project.

2.app.py -: Contains the code regarding 'Flask' 

3.best.onnx -:Open Neural Network Exchange file which contains the trained model 

4.brain-tumor-prediction.ipynb -: Contains the code related to model training using YOLOv8 nano model

5.index.html -: Has the UI of FLask webapp 

6.requiremets.txt -: Contains required libraries 

**How to run this app**
Clone the repo -: git clone https://github.com/Siddharth330-max/Brain_Tumor_Type_prediction.git  

In your terminal -:

pip install -r requirements.txt 

python app.py
